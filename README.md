**Growth Mindset**  
Growth mindset can open different ways to more creativity and possibility, setting yourself up for greater goals and more achievement. In general it's swiching your mind from fixed "I can't do this" to growth " I can do this".   
  
***For example;***
>Instead of saying I'm afraid to fail, remind yourself that failure is part of the process.  
>Instead of saying I'm not smart enough, remind yourself the you can always train your brain for anything, even if it takes time.  
>Instead of running away from challenges, learn to overcome them. Treat it like leveling up in a video game.
